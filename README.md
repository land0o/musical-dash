This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

MusicalDash

I came up with the idea for this app after I was tasked with building a playlist for the family cookout, after reading replies and inputting 400 songs into a playlist I learned about Spotify collaborative playlist. So I decided to build an app that allowed user to chat and build playlist together so I would never have to build such a large playlist by myself again. MusicalDash allows users to chat, create update delete playlist, add/remove songs, and play music through their connected spotify device. 

How to run this app
Clone the project and install all dependencies using the command line:
npm install
To start the app use the command line:
npm start

If you want to use this app in another project you will need to Create/register the app with Spotify, see below.
Create/register the app here https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login after you register your app you will get your own unique API keys, replace the keys in the Auth file.
